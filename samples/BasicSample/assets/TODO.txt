--------------

- fix module/cue render bug, handles should only be visible if the the module is entirely included in the time window
- OSC controller + OSC debugger to log and send out states or failure via OSC + OSC console to remotely catch the logs
- minimal view: render blocks as thin rectangles like in Ableton
- include licensing
- xml cinder block template
- find out why the new module takes so long to be created
- audio item serialization
- time window is buggy
- timeline should be based on the bmp, time can be shown as extra label? BMP unit should also sort out some approximation errors(zoom, time window etc)
